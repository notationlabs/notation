The reconciler now replaces a resource when a change cannot be applied as an update: a change to an `immutable`, `primaryKey` or `secondaryKey` param, or any change to a resource with no `update` operation. Plans gain `replace` and `drift-replace` decisions with the `replaceFields` that force them, and `notation plan` marks replacements with `-/+`. A replacement deletes the resource and then creates it again, and its dependents plan against unknown params. The comparison lives in `diffParams` in `@notation/resource`, so any engine planning a Notation resource reaches the same decision. Drift now compares only fields present both remotely and in the desired params, and an unset param is treated as absent rather than unknown. The update operation now fails for a resource with no `update`, where it used to skip the change silently.
