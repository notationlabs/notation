`ResourceGroup` now takes its config as its own argument: `super(type, id, config)`. Previously, every key except `id` and `dependencies` was collected into `group.config`, so a config with its own `id` or `dependencies` key lost it to the group.

`ResourceGroup` and `AwsResourceGroup` take an optional type parameter for the config, so `group.config` is typed. `LambdaGroup`, `ApiGroup` and `ScheduleGroup` use it, and `LambdaGroup.config` is now the `LambdaConfig` itself rather than `{ config: LambdaConfig }`.
