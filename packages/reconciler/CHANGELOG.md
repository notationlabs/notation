# @notation/reconciler

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- b7119a8: Add durable Yieldstar 0.5.0 deploy and destroy workflows, a resident Node SQLite runtime for CLI execution, versioned event streams, backend-neutral dashboard state, and compiled infrastructure graphs.
- f7e9186: A resource `read` now returns the remote object or throws the tagged `ResourceNotFoundError`. Operations that have started but not settled throw `ResourceOperationPendingError` with their retry delay and optional callback context. The reconciler follows those explicit instructions instead of guessing retry behaviour from provider errors or call-site context.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `notation plan` command backed by a serializable `Plan` and
  `Reconciler.plan()`, surfacing the deploy/destroy operations a run would
  perform before executing them.

  Also bumps dependencies to clear all outstanding security advisories and
  upgrades the core toolchain: TypeScript 6, Vite 8, Vitest 4, and glob 13.
