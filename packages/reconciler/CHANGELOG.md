# @notation/reconciler

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 7a90e6b: Resource groups now have stable string IDs. Previously, a group's ID was its position in the graph, so adding a group shifted the IDs of every group declared after it, and groups built outside a graph all had the ID `-1`.

  - `ResourceGroup` requires an `id`, a string that must be unique among groups of the same type. Declaring two groups with the same type and ID in one graph throws.
  - `LambdaGroup` uses the lambda's `id`, `ApiGroup` the API's `name`, `RouteGroup` `<api id>-<method>-<path>` and `ScheduleGroup` the schedule's `name`.
  - `ResourceGroup`'s `type`, `id`, `config` and `resources` are read-only.
  - Resources record their group as `resource.group`, a `{ type, id }` pair, or `null` if they are in no group. This replaces `groupId` and `groupType`, in memory and in persisted state. `@notation/resource` and `@notation/core` export the pair's type as `ResourceGroupRef`.
  - The dashboard labels groups by type and ID, such as `Lambda get-todos`, instead of by position.

  State written by earlier versions still loads, deploys and destroys. Its records keep `groupId` and `groupType` until their resource is next created or updated, and the dashboard lists them as ungrouped until then.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 9afdb3c: The reconciler now replaces a resource when a change cannot be applied as an update: a change to an `immutable`, `primaryKey` or `secondaryKey` param, or any change to a resource with no `update` operation. Plans gain `replace` and `drift-replace` decisions with the `replaceFields` that force them, and `notation plan` marks replacements with `-/+`. A replacement deletes the resource and then creates it again, and its dependents plan against unknown params. The comparison lives in `diffParams` in `@notation/resource`, so any engine planning a Notation resource reaches the same decision. Drift now compares only fields present both remotely and in the desired params, and an unset param is treated as absent rather than unknown. The update operation now fails for a resource with no `update`, where it used to skip the change silently.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- b7119a8: Add durable Yieldstar 0.5.0 deploy and destroy workflows, a resident Node SQLite runtime for CLI execution, versioned event streams, backend-neutral dashboard state, and compiled infrastructure graphs.
- f7e9186: A resource `read` now returns the remote object or throws the tagged `ResourceNotFoundError`. Operations that have started but not settled throw `ResourceOperationPendingError` with their retry delay and optional callback context. The reconciler follows those explicit instructions instead of guessing retry behaviour from provider errors or call-site context.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `notation plan` command backed by a serializable `Plan` and
  `Reconciler.plan()`, surfacing the deploy/destroy operations a run would
  perform before executing them.

  Also bumps dependencies to clear all outstanding security advisories and
  upgrades the core toolchain: TypeScript 6, Vite 8, Vitest 4, and glob 13.
