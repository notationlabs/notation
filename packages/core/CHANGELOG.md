# @notation/core

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 19a9d2e: Collected params: several pieces of code can add to one param.

  - A schema item with `collect` makes its param collected. `collect` combines the config value and every contribution, sorted by content.
  - `resource.contribute(values)` adds to a collected param while infra is evaluated. Contributions close when evaluation ends.
  - `resource.contribute(({ deps }) => values, { deps })` adds values computed from the real outputs of `deps` at deploy. The resource depends on `deps`.
  - `mergeContributions` merges maps key by key. Two contributions that set one key to different values throw `ContributionConflictError`, which names the `file:line` of both `contribute` calls.

  Output values: config can hold a resource's output before the resource exists.

  - `resource.outputValue(key)` returns a token. The holder depends on the resource, and deploy replaces the token with the real output.
  - Turning a token into a string throws `OutputValueStringError`. Compute with outputs in `deriveParams` or a function contribution.

  Plan:

  - A value that waits on an undeployed output shows as unknown at its own path.
  - `deriveParams` and function contributions receive views of their deps. Reading the output of an undeployed dep throws `PendingOutput`, and plan marks the affected params unknown.
  - Plan and deploy fail when a resource depends on a resource that is not part of the deployment. Before, the graph ignored the edge.

  Other:

  - `resource.dependOn(other)` adds a dependency after construction.
  - `onEvaluationEnd(callback)` runs a callback after evaluation, before contributions close.
  - `@notation/utils` adds `sortedJson`, JSON with sorted keys.

- 7d01d51: Migrate the durable runtime to yieldstar 0.8.2.

  - `--execution-id` now reports the recorded error for a `failed` execution instead of replaying it. Start a new deploy to recover.
  - When the workflow throws, the execution releases its deployment hold.
  - The reconciler keeps the properties of a `create` or `read` result that the schema declares. A `Date`, `Map`, `Set` or `bigint` is recorded as it is. A `Buffer` or other class instance fails the step with `WorkflowValueError` (`INVALID_STEP_VALUE`).
  - Databases, executions and tables from yieldstar 0.5 are not migrated.
  - Each create attempt runs as a yieldstar `step.effect`. When the outcome of an attempt is unknown, the reconciler looks the resource up before it calls `create` again. The outcome is unknown after the process stops between `create` and the recorded result, or when `create` throws `ResourceCreationUnknownError`. Create attempt step keys change from `*:create:remote:attempt:<n>` to `*:create:remote:effect:<n>`.

  `@notation/resource` and `@notation/state`:

  - `defineOperations` takes an optional `find(params, token)`. `create` throws the new `ResourceCreationUnknownError` when it cannot tell whether the provider made the resource. `create` receives the attempt's token as its third argument. `Resource.keyOf(output)` returns the key that `output` gives.
  - `DurableValue`, `DurableObject` and `Durable<T>` describe the values the reconciler records. `Resource.toResult` keeps the properties of a provider result that the schema declares.
  - A provider that returns a `Buffer` does not compile. `StateNode` holds durable values, and `ResourceOperationPendingError.callbackContext` is a `DurableObject`.

  `@notation/std.iac` and `@notation/aws.iac`:

  - The Zip and File outputs replace `file` with `fileSha256`.
  - The Lambda's `Code` param is replaced by `CodeFilePath`.
  - The Lambda's `CodeSha256` param holds a base64 SHA-256 of the uploaded bytes instead of a hex SHA-256 of the source. Drift detection no longer reports every Lambda. On the first deploy after the upgrade, each Lambda uploads its code once.
  - An API Gateway API is tagged `notation:create-token` with a hash of its create token, and its read leaves the tag out of `Tags`. A Lambda function gets the same tag. After a create with an unknown outcome, the API is found by the tag, a route by its route key, and a Lambda function by its name and the tag. A function with the same name and without the tag fails the create instead of being taken over. An API, route or Lambda create that times out, loses its connection or gets a server error is looked up instead of failing the deploy.
  - An API Gateway integration or authorizer cannot be looked up. After a create with an unknown outcome, the next deploy can create a second one that Notation does not record or delete. See the API Gateway docs.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- b290eb1: Resources and resource groups take their ID as their first argument, ahead of their options:

  ```ts
  // before
  new LambdaIamRole({ id: "todos-role", config: { RoleName: "todos-role" } });
  super("Lambda", { id: config.id, config });

  // after
  new LambdaIamRole("todos-role", { config: { RoleName: "todos-role" } });
  super("Lambda", config.id, config);
  ```

  - A resource's options can be left out when neither `config` nor `dependencies` has a required property: `new TestResource("a")`.
  - `ResourceGroup.addOnce` takes the ID separately: `group.addOnce(LambdaIntegration, id, { dependencies })`.
  - `ResourceOpts` no longer includes `id`.
  - `ResourceGroupOptions` is removed.

  The `@notation/aws` functions, such as `lambda({ id, ... })`, still take an object.

- 4fe4451: Paths are now relative to the project root (the nearest directory with a package.json, starting from the working directory), not the working directory. This covers deployment IDs, Lambda IDs, build output, the state database and the files that file and zip resources read. You can run the CLI from any folder inside the project and get the same result.

  This is a breaking change. Deployment IDs used to be absolute paths, so Notation will not find the state of existing deployments. Destroy them before upgrading, or redeploy and delete the old resources by hand.

- 7a90e6b: Resource groups now have stable string IDs. Previously, a group's ID was its position in the graph, so adding a group shifted the IDs of every group declared after it, and groups built outside a graph all had the ID `-1`.

  - `ResourceGroup` requires an `id`, a string that must be unique among groups of the same type. Declaring two groups with the same type and ID in one graph throws.
  - `LambdaGroup` uses the lambda's `id`, `ApiGroup` the API's `name`, `RouteGroup` `<api id>-<method>-<path>` and `ScheduleGroup` the schedule's `name`.
  - `ResourceGroup`'s `type`, `id`, `config` and `resources` are read-only.
  - Resources record their group as `resource.group`, a `{ type, id }` pair, or `null` if they are in no group. This replaces `groupId` and `groupType`, in memory and in persisted state. `@notation/resource` and `@notation/core` export the pair's type as `ResourceGroupRef`.
  - The dashboard labels groups by type and ID, such as `Lambda get-todos`, instead of by position.

  State written by earlier versions still loads, deploys and destroys. Its records keep `groupId` and `groupType` until their resource is next created or updated, and the dashboard lists them as ungrouped until then.

### Patch Changes

- 425f8ba: `notation viz` charts now render when resource or group names contain characters Mermaid can't use in IDs, such as an API name with a space or a route with a path parameter like `/todos/{id}`. Previously, such names made the chart fail to parse. Nodes and subgraphs now get IDs from their position in the chart, and their names go in quoted, escaped labels that show the type and ID, such as `Lambda get-todos`. Resources that are in no group are drawn too, outside every subgraph.
- 6943418: `diffParams` now puts each changed param in `patch` whole, rather than as a nested diff. Changing one Lambda environment variable no longer drops the others, removing all of them now clears them, and an EventBridge rule update no longer sends a rule with no name or targets keyed by index. `@notation/core` drops its unused `deep-object-diff` dependency.

### Minor Changes

- b7119a8: Add durable Yieldstar 0.5.0 deploy and destroy workflows, a resident Node SQLite runtime for CLI execution, versioned event streams, backend-neutral dashboard state, and compiled infrastructure graphs.
- f7e9186: A resource `read` now returns the remote object or throws the tagged `ResourceNotFoundError`. Operations that have started but not settled throw `ResourceOperationPendingError` with their retry delay and optional callback context. The reconciler follows those explicit instructions instead of guessing retry behaviour from provider errors or call-site context.
